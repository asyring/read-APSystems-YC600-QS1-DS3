# read APS inverters
This project is intended for reading APS Systems inverters. The program can pair and poll YC600 and QS1 inverters, up to 9 peaces. The read values are displayed on a web page and sent via mosquitto in a Json format.
The program has a lot of smart features. All settings can be done via the webinterface. It has a console that can be used for debugging and sending/receiving zigbee messages.

This is for a nodemcu board 31x58mm

## features
- Easy wifi config portal
- Easy add, delete and pair inverters
- automatic polling or on demand via mqtt or http
- data can be requested via http and mosquitto
- There are 2 different json formats, a special one for domoticz
- Fast asyc webserver
- a very smart on-line console to send commands and debug
- Smart timekeeping
- A lot of system info on the webpage

## compile this sketch
Use arduino ide with the esp822 version 2.7.1 installed under boardmanager. The ota updates won't work with other versons.

Or use the binary file ESP-ECU-v6_12 to flash directly on your ESP device.

## the hardware
It is nothing more than an esp device like nodemcu, wemos or its relatives and a prepared cc2530, cc2531 zigbee module. And a powersupply.
The zigbeemodule should be flashed with a firmware that can be found here https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues/4221. Here you can find much more information on this project.

A compiled binary of this software, firmware and additional information can be found here: https://1drv.ms/u/s!AkMG5FvUwhedimnUoBjQROkAaofW?e=zFgWdM, 

the wiring:
### cc2530 -> ESP 
-  p2   -> d8
-  p3   -> d7
-  vcc  -> 3.3v
-  gnd  -> gnd
-  rst  -> d5

## how does it work
The APS system works with a separate zigbee implementation. The ESP-ECU sends zigbee requests to the inverters and analyzes the answers, extracting the values. 
The ESP communicates with the zigbee module through the alternative serial port.
The ESP-ECU starts a coordinator (an entity that can start a zigbee network). The coordinator binds the inverters and sends the poll requests to them.
The interesting values are send via mqtt and displayed on the main page.

## know issues
The zigbee module crashes sometimes during the pollings. The system recovers that by resetting it and start the coordinator again. This is done by a healthcheck that runs every 10 minutes. You can only notice this via the log and infopage where this is counted.
